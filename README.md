# Pin My YouTube video *Electron*

**Based on [Electron quick start boilerplate](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start)**

This is my very first Electron project, it was inspired by a previous application I made using Autoplay Media Studio (by drag and drop, with no experience in programming), and I called it [YouTube tuto helper](http://fcmam5-aio.blogspot.com/2014/04/youtube-tuto-helper-beta.html).
